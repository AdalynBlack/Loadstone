## v0.0.3
- Changed the default value of Async Gen Wait Time to be 30ms instead of 100ms
	- Testing has shown that this has negligible impact on loading times, but should increase smoothness during loading dramatically
- Fixed config naming
	- The old config should be ported automatically, and will automatically apply the above wait-time change if the previous default of 100ms is detected
- Changed the package description
- More README modifications

## v0.0.2
- Fixed some mistakes in the README
- Added more verbose debugging during patching
- Fixed #1, where a partial failure of one patch was occurring when using the automatic HarmonyX backend

## v0.0.1
- Fixed README formatting
